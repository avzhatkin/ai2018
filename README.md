# ai2018
Strategy from [Russian AI Cup 2018](http://russianaicup.ru)  
Strategy source itself is just **MyStrategy.cpp** and **MyStrategy.h**, the rest is just default c++17 package provided by orgs.
### Revisions
1. "Dumb strategy 1" - simple hit&run logic. Still doing great in beta stage though (:

Futher on the previous strategy source code will be uploaded once a new strategy revision is in game
